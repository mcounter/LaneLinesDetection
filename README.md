# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
Finding lane lines on the road with help of algorithmic edge detectors

![Finding Lane Lines on the Road](./images/main.jpg)

Practical project to recognize road marking from images and video streams and highlight (annotate) left and right edges of the road lane. Algorithm is based on Canny edge detector and Hough line segments detector algorithms, provided by OpenCV library. More details are [here](./writeup.md).
